## [1.6.4] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **CI tests now pass in GitHub Actions** 🧪
  - `TestGetGitBranch_RealRepo` failed in CI due to detached HEAD from PR checkout
  - Now uses isolated temporary git repository with known branch name
  - Added `TestGetGitBranch_DetachedHead` to verify empty string for detached HEAD

## [1.6.3] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed
- **Fixed fallback logic in content lock** 🔒
  - v1.6.2 had a bug: when lock was busy, code still proceeded without lock
  - Now correctly exits when another process holds the lock
  - Only uses fallback on actual errors (e.g., /tmp unavailable)

## [1.6.2] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed
- **Race condition in content-based deduplication** 🔒
  - Stop and Notification hooks were running simultaneously, both passing duplicate check
  - Added shared content lock to serialize duplicate check and state update
  - Now only one hook can check and save notification state at a time
  - Prevents duplicate notifications when different hooks fire near-simultaneously

## [1.6.1] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed
- **Version numbers no longer break sentence extraction** 🔧
  - Text like "Бинарник v1.6.0 установлен!" was incorrectly cut at "v1."
  - Now correctly handles version numbers, decimals, IP addresses
  - Dots after digits are no longer treated as sentence endings

## [1.6.0] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **Folder name in notification titles** 📁
  - Notification titles now show the project folder name
  - Format: `✅ Completed [session-name] main my-project`
  - Helps identify which project the notification is from

- **Content-based duplicate detection** 🔇
  - Prevents duplicate notifications with similar text within 3 minutes
  - Normalizes messages (ignores trailing dots, case differences)
  - Example: "Completed" and "Question" with same text won't both show
  - Fixes issue where different hooks sent near-identical notifications

## [1.5.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added
- **Git branch name in notifications** 🌿
  - Notification titles now show the current git branch
  - Format: `✅ Completed [session-name] main`
  - Only shown when working in a git repository

## [1.4.2] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed
- **Click-to-focus now works on macOS Sequoia (15.x)** 🎯
  - Removed `-sender` option that was conflicting with `-activate`
  - Trade-off: notifications no longer show custom Claude icon
  - Click-to-focus now reliably activates terminal window

## [1.4.1] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed
- Skip terminal-notifier integration test in CI (no NotificationCenter available)

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-24

### Added
- **Click-to-focus notifications on macOS** 🎯
  - Clicking a notification activates your terminal window
  - Auto-detects terminal app (Warp, iTerm, Terminal, kitty, Alacritty, etc.)
  - Uses `terminal-notifier` under the hood
  - Enable with `"clickToFocus": true` in desktop config (enabled by default)
  - Manual override: `"terminalBundleID": "com.your.terminal"`

- **Claude icon in notifications** 🤖 *(removed in 1.4.2 due to macOS Sequoia conflict)*
  - Custom Claude icon displayed on the left side of macOS notifications
  - Auto-creates `ClaudeNotifications.app` on first notification
  - ⚠️ Removed in v1.4.2: `-sender` option conflicted with click-to-focus on macOS 15.x

### Changed
- **Shorter notification titles**
  - `✅ Task Completed` → `✅ Completed`
  - `🔍 Review Completed` → `🔍 Review`
  - `❓ Claude Has Questions` → `❓ Question`
  - `📋 Plan Ready for Review` → `📋 Plan`

### Technical
- Terminal bundle ID detection via `__CFBundleIdentifier` and `TERM_PROGRAM`
- ~~Uses `-sender com.claude.notifications` for reliable icon display~~ (removed in 1.4.2)

## [1.3.0] - 2025-12-24

## [1.2.1] - 2025-12-14

### Fixed
- **Webhook notifications never sent** ([#6](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/issues/6))
  - `Shutdown()` now waits for in-flight HTTP requests to complete before exit
  - Added `defer webhookSvc.Shutdown(5s)` to `HandleHook()` for graceful shutdown
  - Previously: `cancel()` was called immediately, interrupting HTTP requests
  - Now: `cancel()` is only called after completion or on timeout

### Added
- E2E test `TestE2E_WebhookGracefulShutdown` - deterministic graceful shutdown verification
- Unit tests for `Shutdown()` + `SendAsync()` combination
- Updated `webhookInterface` to include `Shutdown(timeout)` method

## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-03

### Added
- **Subagent notification control** - New config option `notifyOnSubagentStop`
  - Prevents premature "Completed" notifications when Task agents (subagents) finish
  - Main Claude session continues working without distracting notifications
  - Default: `false` (notifications disabled for subagents)
  - Users can enable via `"notifyOnSubagentStop": true` in config if desired
  - Fixes issue where Plan/Explore agents triggered completion notifications while Claude was still thinking

### Changed
- SubagentStop hook now checks config before sending notifications
- Split SubagentStop and Stop hook handling for better control

### Technical Details
- Added `NotifyOnSubagentStop` boolean field to `NotificationsConfig` struct
- Updated hook handler in `internal/hooks/hooks.go` to respect config setting
- Added comprehensive tests for both enabled and disabled states
- All existing tests pass with new functionality

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-25

  - Simplified volume conversion logic (linear instead of logarithmic)
  - Affects both notification sounds and `sound-preview` utility
  - All tests passing with new implementation
- **GitHub Actions build step** - Windows builds now work correctly
  - Added `shell: bash` to build step for all platforms
  - Resolved PowerShell syntax error preventing Windows builds from completing

### Changed
- Simplified `volumeToGain()` function - removed complex logarithmic calculations
- Updated documentation in code to reflect linear gain formula: `output = input * (1 + Gain)`

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-25

  - Added `sound-preview` utility to build system

  - Handles MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, AIFF formats

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-25

### Added

  - Triggered when both "API Error: 401" and "Please run /login" appear in assistant messages
  - Priority detection (checks before tool-based detection)
  - Added comprehensive tests for API error detection

### Improved

  - Binary size reduced from ~10 MB to ~7 MB per platform
  - Faster download times for users (5 seconds instead of 8 seconds)
  - Better privacy (no developer paths in binaries)
  - Deterministic builds across different machines
  - Development builds unchanged (still include debug symbols)

### Changed
- Updated notification count from 5 to 6 types in README
- All tests passing with new features

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-24

### Fixed
- Critical bug in duration calculation ("Took" time in notifications)
  - User text messages were not being detected in transcript parsing
  - `GetLastUserTimestamp` now correctly parses string content format
  - Duration now shows accurate time (e.g., "Took 5m" instead of "Took 2h 30m")
  - Tool counting now accurate (prevents showing inflated counts like "Edited 32 files")
- Added custom JSON marshaling/unmarshaling for `MessageContent` to handle both string and array content formats

### Technical Details
- Fixed `pkg/jsonl/jsonl.go`: Added `ContentString` field and custom `UnmarshalJSON`/`MarshalJSON` methods
