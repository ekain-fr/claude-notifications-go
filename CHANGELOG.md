## [1.20.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **ClaudeNotifier.app Swift rewrite** — full rewrite of the macOS notifier as a Swift package with UNUserNotificationCenter, hybrid fallback to osascript, and click-to-focus via NSWorkspace
- **Notification subtitle** — git branch and folder name shown as native subtitle (`main · my-project`) instead of being crammed into the title
- **Notification actions** — "Open" and "Dismiss" buttons on long-press/swipe via UNNotificationCategory
- **Thread grouping** — notifications grouped by session ID via `threadIdentifier`, no longer replacing each other
- **Time-sensitive notifications** — API errors and session limits break through Focus Mode via `interruptionLevel = .timeSensitive` (macOS 12+)
- **`-nosound` flag** — suppresses Swift notification sound so Go audio player is the single sound source (fixes double sound)
- **tmux click-to-focus** — clicking a notification in tmux switches to the correct window and pane via `-execute`
- **tmux E2E tests** — comprehensive integration tests for tmux pane detection, args building, and socket path extraction
- **install.sh ClaudeNotifier.app support** — downloads signed+notarized ClaudeNotifier.app.zip from GitHub Releases

### Fixed
- **tmux shell quoting** — tmux path and socket path properly quoted with single quotes in `-execute` commands
- **ARC delegate lifetime** — `withExtendedLifetime(appDelegate)` prevents premature deallocation in callback mode
- **AppleScript newline escaping** — newlines and carriage returns stripped from title/message/subtitle before passing to osascript
- **build-app.sh codesign** — `CODESIGN_FLAGS` converted from string to bash array to handle spaces in entitlements path
- **Flaky CI connectivity check** — `SKIP_CONNECTIVITY_CHECK` env var for E2E tests to avoid flaky `curl https://github.com` timeouts on macOS runners

### Changed
- **`SendDesktop` signature** — now accepts `sessionID` for thread grouping: `SendDesktop(status, message, sessionID)`
- **Notification title** — cleaned up to show only status emoji + session name, metadata moved to subtitle

## [1.19.0] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **Config survives plugin updates** — config.json moved to `~/.claude/claude-notifications-go/config.json` outside the plugin cache, so settings are no longer lost when bootstrap.sh clears the cache during updates ([#30](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/issues/30))
- **Automatic migration** — existing config is auto-migrated from the old location on first run (atomic write with temp file + rename)
- **Resilient fallback chain** — corrupted config never crashes the plugin; falls back to legacy path or defaults with stderr warnings
- **Cross-platform test isolation** — `setTestHome` helper correctly sets both HOME and USERPROFILE for Windows compatibility
- **Lint errcheck** — fixed unchecked `os.Chmod` return value in test cleanup

### Changed
- **Settings wizard** — now writes config to both stable and legacy paths for backward compatibility with older binary versions
- **Documentation** — all config path references updated across README, webhook guides, and architecture docs

## [1.18.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **ntfy.sh webhook documentation** — custom webhook example for push notifications via ntfy.sh ([#29](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/29))

### Fixed
- **Bootstrap: version symlinks** — after update, creates symlinks from old version dirs to the new one so running Claude Code sessions don't break before restart
- **Bootstrap: Bash 3.2 compatibility** — fixed empty array handling for macOS default bash

### Changed
- **Updating section in README** — simplified to use the same bootstrap command as installation
- **Bootstrap success message** — clarifies that update command is same as install

## [1.17.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **One-command bootstrap installer** — `curl -fsSL .../bootstrap.sh | bash` handles marketplace setup, plugin install, and binary download in a single command
- **`error.mp3` sound** — dedicated error alert sound for API errors and session limit notifications (replaces reused `question.mp3`)

### Changed
- **Session names** — simplified from two-word `bold-cat` to single-word `cat` format for cleaner notification titles
- **Notification title format** — session ID moved after branch name: `✅ Completed main [cat]` instead of `✅ Completed [bold-cat] main`
- **README installation section** — bootstrap method is now primary, manual install moved to collapsible fallback

## [1.16.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Terminal bell for tab indicators** 🔔 ([#28](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/28), thanks @retr0h!)
  - Sends BEL character (`\a`) to trigger terminal tab indicators (Ghostty tab highlight, tmux window bell flag)
  - Works independently of desktop notifications — bell fires even when desktop notifications are disabled
  - New `terminalBell` config option (default: `true`)
  - Cross-platform: `/dev/tty` on Unix, `os.Stdout` on Windows
  - Graceful degradation: silently skipped if TTY unavailable (Docker, CI, piped environments)
- **`list-sounds` CLI utility** — lists all available notification sound files ([#23](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/issues/23))
- **`/sounds` skill command** — interactive sound browser with preview from Claude Code

### Changed
- Updated notification sound files for plan readiness and review completion statuses

## [1.15.1] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **GNOME Terminal detection** — detect GNOME Terminal via `GNOME_TERMINAL_SCREEN` / `GNOME_TERMINAL_SERVICE` env vars for click-to-focus support on Linux ([#22](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/22), thanks @ductrantrong)

### Fixed
- **Windows checksum verification** — strip leading backslash from `sha256sum` output on Windows (MSYS2/Git Bash/Cygwin) which caused checksum mismatch ([#26](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/issues/26))

## [1.15.0] - 2026-02-07

### Changed
- **Unified API Error notifications** — merged `api_error` (401) and `api_error_overloaded` into a single API Error type in documentation
- **Updating section** — documented auto-update mechanism via `hook-wrapper.sh` with manual fallback
- **Release checklist** — added [docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md) with version bump locations, auto-update explanation, and full release steps

### Fixed
- **install.sh** — `install_gnome_activate_window_extension()` now returns failure code when GNOME shell/extensions not found or extension couldn't be enabled ([#19](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/pull/19))

## [1.14.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **Per-status notification control** 🎛️ ([#16](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/issues/16))
  - Disable individual notification types (e.g., disable only `task_complete` while keeping others)
  - New `enabled` field in status config: `"enabled": false` to disable a specific type
  - Backward compatible: missing `enabled` field defaults to `true`
  - Updated `/notifications-settings` wizard with Step 4.5 for selecting notification types
  - Example config to disable task_complete:
    ```json
    {
      "statuses": {
        "task_complete": { "enabled": false, "title": "...", "sound": "..." }
      }
    }
    ```

### Technical
- Added `Enabled *bool` field to `StatusInfo` struct (pointer for nil = true default)
- New methods: `IsStatusEnabled()`, `IsStatusDesktopEnabled()`, `IsStatusWebhookEnabled()`
- Updated `sendNotifications()` to check per-status enabled
- 14 new tests for per-status enabled functionality

## [1.13.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Console notification on plugin update** - shows warning message in Claude Code console when binary is installed or updated
  - First install: `[claude-notifications] Installed v1.13.0`
  - Update: `[claude-notifications] Updated to v1.13.0`
  - Uses `systemMessage` JSON format for Claude Code hook response

### Technical
- Added `systemMessage` output to `hook-wrapper.sh` for user-visible notifications
- New E2E test for systemMessage output

## [1.12.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Automatic version-aware updates** - wrapper now checks if binary version matches plugin version
  - After Claude auto-updates plugin files, binary is automatically updated on next hook call
  - Compares `claude-notifications version` output with `plugin.json` version
  - Uses `--force` flag to replace outdated binaries
  - Fallback: if version check fails, still works based on file existence

### Technical
- Added version comparison logic to `hook-wrapper.sh`
- 4 new E2E tests for version checking (mismatch triggers update, match skips update, etc.)

## [1.11.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Auto-download after plugin auto-update** - binaries now download automatically when hook is first called
  - Previously: after Claude auto-updated the plugin, binary was missing and hooks failed
  - Now: `hook-wrapper.sh` detects missing binary and triggers download on first use
  - Zero downtime: if download fails, hooks exit gracefully without blocking Claude
  - POSIX-compatible wrapper works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (Git Bash)

### Technical
- New `bin/hook-wrapper.sh` - lazy binary download wrapper
- Updated `hooks/hooks.json` - all hooks now use wrapper
- 17 new E2E tests for hook-wrapper covering offline, mock, and real network scenarios

## [1.10.0] - 2026-01-10

### Added
- **`notifyOnTextResponse` config option** - notifications now arrive for text-only responses (e.g., extended thinking "Baked for 32s")
  - Default: `true` (enabled)
  - Set to `false` in config to disable notifications when Claude responds without using tools

### Fixed
- Fixed test flakiness on Go 1.25+ by cleaning up stale state files between test runs

## [1.9.0] - 2026-01-10

### Added
- **Windows CI tests** - install.sh now tested on all 3 platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **Binary execution verification** - installer now verifies downloaded binary actually runs (`--version` check)
- **Network error diagnostics** - detailed hints for DNS, SSL, timeout, and firewall issues
- **Graceful offline mode** - if GitHub is unreachable but binary exists, uses existing installation

### Improved
- **Cross-platform compatibility** for install.sh:
  - Windows-compatible `ping` syntax (`-n/-w` instead of `-c/-W`)
  - Portable temp directory (`${TMPDIR:-${TEMP:-/tmp}}`)
  - Proper `.bat` wrapper creation on Windows
  - Extended regex with `grep -E` for portability
- **E2E test coverage** - 35+ tests covering offline, mock server, and real network scenarios
- **Utility downloads are now non-blocking** - if sound-preview or list-devices fail, main install continues

### Fixed
- Fixed installer hanging when optional utility downloads fail
- Fixed checksum verification for cross-platform builds

## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-10

### Added
- **double-shot-latte compatibility** 🤝
  - Notifications are now automatically suppressed when running in background judge mode
  - Detects `CLAUDE_HOOK_JUDGE_MODE=true` environment variable set by [double-shot-latte](https://github.com/obra/double-shot-latte) plugin
  - Zero configuration required - just update the plugin and it works automatically
  - Other plugin developers can use the same mechanism to suppress notifications in background Claude instances

### Documentation
- Added **🤝 Plugin Compatibility** section to README
- Documented how other plugins can suppress notifications using `CLAUDE_HOOK_JUDGE_MODE=true`

## [1.7.2] - 2026-01-10

### Improved
- **Auto-update now always works** - `/claude-notifications-go:notifications-init` reliably updates binaries even from old cached plugins
  - Downloads latest `install.sh` directly from GitHub before running
  - Uses `--force` flag to replace existing binaries
  - Cross-platform temp directory (`$TMPDIR`, `$TEMP`, `/tmp` fallback)
  - Fixes: old cached plugins used outdated installer without utility download support

## [1.7.1] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed
- **Installer now downloads utility binaries** ([#14](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/issues/14))
  - `sound-preview` and `list-devices` were missing after `/claude-notifications-go:notifications-init`
  - Installer script now downloads all three binaries
  - Creates proper symlinks for all utilities

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-10

### Added
- **Audio device selection support** 🔊 (thanks @tkaufmann!)
  - Route notification sounds to a specific audio output device
  - New `audioDevice` config option in `notifications.desktop` section
  - New `list-devices` CLI tool to enumerate available audio devices

  - More reliable playback on all platforms

### Fixed
- **Windows CI test failures** - Fixed `.exe` extension handling in cross-platform tests
- **Memory safety** - DeviceID now properly copied instead of storing pointer to freed memory
- **Player state check** - Play() now returns error if player is already closed
- **WaitGroup race condition** - Added `closing` flag to prevent race between Close() and playSoundAsync()
- **CI test resilience** - Audio tests now skip gracefully in CI environments without audio backend

## [1.6.6] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed
- **Ghost notifications after 60 seconds** 👻 ([#11](https://github.com/777genius/claude-notifications-go/issues/11))
  - `idle_prompt` hook was firing 60 seconds after `PreToolUse(AskUserQuestion)`
  - This caused duplicate "Question" notifications with delay
  - Now Notification hook only responds to `permission_prompt`, ignoring `idle_prompt`
  - `AskUserQuestion` is already covered by PreToolUse hook (instant notification)

## [1.6.5] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **Proper Unicode handling for multibyte characters** 🌍 (thanks @patrick-fu!)
  - Text truncation now uses rune count instead of byte count
  - Emoji, CJK, Cyrillic and other multibyte characters no longer get cut mid-character
  - `truncateText` and `extractFirstSentence` work correctly with international text

## [1.6.4] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- **CI tests now pass in GitHub Actions** 🧪
  - `TestGetGitBranch_RealRepo` failed in CI due to detached HEAD from PR checkout
  - Now uses isolated temporary git repository with known branch name
  - Added `TestGetGitBranch_DetachedHead` to verify empty string for detached HEAD

## [1.6.3] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed
- **Fixed fallback logic in content lock** 🔒
  - v1.6.2 had a bug: when lock was busy, code still proceeded without lock
  - Now correctly exits when another process holds the lock
  - Only uses fallback on actual errors (e.g., /tmp unavailable)

## [1.6.2] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed
- **Race condition in content-based deduplication** 🔒
  - Stop and Notification hooks were running simultaneously, both passing duplicate check
  - Added shared content lock to serialize duplicate check and state update
  - Now only one hook can check and save notification state at a time
  - Prevents duplicate notifications when different hooks fire near-simultaneously

## [1.6.1] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed
- **Version numbers no longer break sentence extraction** 🔧
  - Text like "Бинарник v1.6.0 установлен!" was incorrectly cut at "v1."
  - Now correctly handles version numbers, decimals, IP addresses
  - Dots after digits are no longer treated as sentence endings

## [1.6.0] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- **Folder name in notification titles** 📁
  - Notification titles now show the project folder name
  - Format: `✅ Completed [session-name] main my-project`
  - Helps identify which project the notification is from

- **Content-based duplicate detection** 🔇
  - Prevents duplicate notifications with similar text within 3 minutes
  - Normalizes messages (ignores trailing dots, case differences)
  - Example: "Completed" and "Question" with same text won't both show
  - Fixes issue where different hooks sent near-identical notifications

## [1.5.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added
- **Git branch name in notifications** 🌿
  - Notification titles now show the current git branch
  - Format: `✅ Completed [session-name] main`

## [1.4.2] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed
- **Click-to-focus now works on macOS Sequoia (15.x)** 🎯
  - Removed `-sender` option that was conflicting with `-activate`
  - Trade-off: notifications no longer show custom Claude icon
  - Click-to-focus now reliably activates terminal window

## [1.4.1] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed
- Skip terminal-notifier integration test in CI (no NotificationCenter available)

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-24

### Added
- **Click-to-focus notifications on macOS** 🎯
  - Clicking a notification activates your terminal window

- **Shorter notification titles**
  - `✅ Task Completed` → `✅ Completed`
  - `🔍 Review Completed` → `🔍 Review`
  - `❓ Claude Has Questions` → `❓ Question`
  - `📋 Plan Ready for Review` → `📋 Plan`

  - `Shutdown()` now waits for in-flight HTTP requests to complete before exit
  - Added `defer webhookSvc.Shutdown(5s)` to `HandleHook()` for graceful shutdown
  - Previously: `cancel()` was called immediately, interrupting HTTP requests
  - Now: `cancel()` is only called after completion or on timeout

### Added
- E2E test `TestE2E_WebhookGracefulShutdown` - deterministic graceful shutdown verification
- Unit tests for `Shutdown()` + `SendAsync()` combination
- Updated `webhookInterface` to include `Shutdown(timeout)` method

## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-03

### Added
