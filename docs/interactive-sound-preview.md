# Interactive Sound Preview

## Overview

The `/setup-notifications` command now includes **interactive sound preview** functionality, allowing users to listen to notification sounds before choosing them.

This feature was inspired by the bash version of the plugin and provides a superior user experience during setup.

## How It Works

### For Users

When running `/setup-notifications`, users can preview any sound by typing:

```
play task-complete
play Glass
preview Hero
прослушать Ping
проиграть Sosumi
```

**Supported languages:**
- English: `play`, `preview`
- Russian: `прослушать`, `проиграть`

### For Claude

The setup wizard command (`commands/setup-notifications.md`) contains detailed instructions for Claude to:

1. **Detect preview requests** - Parse user messages for keywords (play, preview, прослушать, проиграть)
2. **Extract sound name** - Get the sound name from the user's message
3. **Determine sound path** - Resolve to either built-in sound or system sound
4. **Play the sound** - Execute `bin/sound-preview <path>`
5. **Ask for next action** - Let user preview more sounds or proceed with selection

### Preview Flow

```
Step 1-2: Detect system and list available sounds
    ↓
Step 3: INTERACTIVE PREVIEW PHASE
    User: "play Glass"
    Claude: [plays Glass.aiff]
    Claude: "Would you like to hear another sound?"
    User: "preview Hero"
    Claude: [plays Hero.aiff]
    User: "ready"
    ↓
Step 4: Ask 4 questions with AskUserQuestion
    (Users can still preview during questions)
    ↓
Step 5: Webhook configuration
    ↓
Step 6: Generate config.json
    ↓
Step 7: Summary & test
```

## Technical Details

### Sound Preview Utility

The `bin/sound-preview` binary is a Go application that:

- **Supports multiple formats:** MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG/Vorbis, AIFF
- **Native playback:** Uses `gopxl/beep` library (no external dependencies)
- **Cross-platform:** Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Fast:** Loads and plays sounds in <1 second
- **Volume control:** Adjustable volume from 0.0 (silent) to 1.0 (full volume)

**Source:** `cmd/sound-preview/main.go`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Full volume (default)
bin/sound-preview sounds/task-complete.mp3

# 30% volume (recommended for testing)
bin/sound-preview --volume 0.3 sounds/task-complete.mp3

# 50% volume
bin/sound-preview --volume 0.5 /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff

# Show help
bin/sound-preview --help
```

### Available Sounds

**Built-in sounds** (included in `sounds/` directory):
- `task-complete.mp3` - Triumphant completion chime
- `review-complete.mp3` - Gentle notification tone
- `question.mp3` - Attention-grabbing sound
- `plan-ready.mp3` - Professional planning tone

**System sounds** (macOS only):
- Location: `/System/Library/Sounds/*.aiff`
- Examples: Glass, Hero, Funk, Sosumi, Ping, Purr, Basso, Blow, Frog, Submarine, Bottle, Morse, Tink
- Formats: AIFF (automatically handled by sound-preview)

**System sounds** (Linux):
- Location: `/usr/share/sounds/**/*.ogg` (varies by distribution)
- Formats: OGG Vorbis, WAV

### Error Handling

If a sound is not found:

```
User: play unknown-sound
Claude: "❌ Sound 'unknown-sound' not found. Available sounds are:
  Built-in: task-complete, review-complete, question, plan-ready
  System (macOS): Glass, Hero, Funk, Sosumi, Ping, Purr, Basso, etc.
Try: 'play Glass' or 'preview task-complete'"
```

## Example Usage

### Complete Setup Flow

```
User: /setup-notifications

Claude: [detects system, lists available sounds]

Claude: "🎵 Want to hear sounds before choosing?
I can play any sound for you! Just say:
- 'play task-complete' - Built-in task-complete sound
- 'play Glass' - macOS Glass system sound
- 'preview Hero' - Preview any available sound

Try as many as you like! When you're ready, I'll ask you to select sounds."

User: play Glass

Claude: [executes: bin/sound-preview --volume 0.3 /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff]
Claude: "🔊 Playing: Glass... (volume: 30%) ✓ Playback complete!
Would you like to hear another sound, or ready to choose?"

User: play Hero

Claude: [executes: bin/sound-preview --volume 0.3 /System/Library/Sounds/Hero.aiff]
Claude: "🔊 Playing: Hero... (volume: 30%) ✓ Playback complete!"

User: ready

Claude: "Great! Let's configure your notification sounds..."
Claude: [proceeds with AskUserQuestion for 4 notification types]
```

### Preview During Questions

Users can still preview sounds even after the preview phase:

```
Claude: "🎵 Reminder: You can still preview sounds! Just say 'play [sound_name]' before making your choice."
Claude: [shows AskUserQuestion: "Which sound for Task Complete notifications?"]

User: wait, let me hear Funk first

Claude: [executes: bin/sound-preview --volume 0.3 /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff]
Claude: "🔊 Playing: Funk... (volume: 30%) ✓ Playback complete!"
Claude: [re-shows the question]

User: [selects Funk from options]
```

## Benefits

✅ **Better UX** - Users can hear sounds before choosing
✅ **Reduces mistakes** - No need to reconfigure after selecting wrong sounds
✅ **Supports multiple languages** - English and Russian commands
✅ **Patient interaction** - Users can preview as many sounds as they want
✅ **No external tools** - Uses built-in `bin/sound-preview` binary

## Comparison with Bash Version

| Feature | Bash Version | Go Version |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Interactive preview | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Sound preview during questions | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Russian commands | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Cross-platform | ✅ macOS/Linux/Windows | ✅ macOS/Linux/Windows |
| Sound playback | `afplay` (macOS only) | Native Go (all platforms) |
| Supported formats | MP3, AIFF, OGG | MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, AIFF |

## Testing

To test the sound preview utility manually:

```bash
# Test built-in sound (full volume)
./bin/sound-preview sounds/task-complete.mp3

# Test with reduced volume (30% - recommended for testing)
./bin/sound-preview --volume 0.3 sounds/task-complete.mp3

# Test macOS system sound at 30% volume
./bin/sound-preview --volume 0.3 /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff

# Test Linux system sound at 50% volume
./bin/sound-preview --volume 0.5 /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga

# Test very quiet (10% volume)
./bin/sound-preview --volume 0.1 sounds/question.mp3

# Show help and options
./bin/sound-preview --help

# Should show error for non-existent file
./bin/sound-preview non-existent.mp3

# Should show error for invalid volume
./bin/sound-preview --volume 1.5 sounds/task-complete.mp3  # Volume must be 0.0-1.0
```

**Volume Recommendations:**
- **Testing/development:** Use `--volume 0.3` (30%) to avoid disturbing others
- **Setup wizard preview:** Always use `--volume 0.3` (30%)
- **User volume preference test:** Use `--volume 1.0` (full volume, default)
- **Very quiet environment:** Use `--volume 0.1` (10%)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- [ ] Show sound duration before playing
- [ ] Add volume control option
- [ ] Preview multiple sounds in sequence (e.g., "play all")
- [ ] Visual waveform display (low priority)
- [ ] Save favorite sounds list for quick access
